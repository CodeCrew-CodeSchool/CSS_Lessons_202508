                My baby want a Birkin, she's been telling me all night long <br>

Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on <br>

This 9 to 5 ain't working, why the hell do I work so hard? <br>

I can't worry about my problems, I can't take them when I'm gone <br>

One, here comes the two to the three to the four <br>

Tell 'em bring another out, we need plenty more <br>

Two stepping on the table, she don't need a dance floor <br>

Oh my, good Lord <br>

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey <br>

They know me and Jack Daniels got a history <br>

There's a party downtown near fifth street <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>

I've been Boozey since I've left, I ain't changing for a check <br>

Tell my ma I ain't forget (Oh Lord) <br>

Woke up drunk at 10am, we gone do this shit again <br>

Tell your girl to bring a friend (Oh Lord) <br>

One, here comes the two to the three to the four <br>

Tell 'em bring another out, we need plenty more <br>

Two stepping on the table, she don't need a dance floor <br>

Oh my, good Lord <br>

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey <br>

They know me and Jack Daniels got a history <br>

There's a party downtown near fifth street <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>

One, here comes the two to the three to the four <br>

When it's last call and they kick us out the door <br>

It's getting kind of late but the ladies want some more <br>

Oh my, good Lord <br>

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey <br>

They know me and Jack Daniels got a history <br>

There's a party downtown near fifth street <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey <br>

They know me and Jack Daniels got a history <br>

At the bottom of a bottle gone miss me <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>

Everybody at the bar getting tipsy <br>
